# R-Housing-Schools
Data Analysis and Visualization in R

## CONTEXT
A small, private housing organization is looking to expand on opportunities in new neighborhoods. Although the organization cannot disclose much about their project, they would still like an outside opinion on housing market patterns in certain neighborhoods.

The organization has hired you as a consultant to analyze a subset of their data and provide recommendations for areas of potential growth. The organization has a mix of people with varying data science backgrounds. The ones who will be reading your report range from somewhat familiar with data science to completely unfamiliar with data science. They have asked you to make sure that your report is clear to all readers. The organization would also like an annotated copy of your R-code in case they need to re-run analyses.

## WHAT IS DONE
Data exploration, data cleaning, merge of the 2 datasets, one-variable visuals (histograms, bar plots, box plots), two-variable visuals (scatter plots, high-density plots), analysis (regression, clustering)...
